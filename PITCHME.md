### What's in a map?
- Key features of a *good* map:
 1. **Visual Contrast:** The data are the stars of the show
 2. **Legibility:** Data are seen *and understood*. Selection of appropriate symbols/sizes is key.
 3. **[Figure-Ground Organization](https://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2011/02/15/graphic-design-principles-for-mapping-figure-ground-organization/):** Separation of main figure from background. 
 4. **Hierarchical Organization:** Within data layers themselves, and within map elements (title, north arrow, etc.)
 5. **Visual Balance:** Effective use of white space and positioning of visual elements within a layout
